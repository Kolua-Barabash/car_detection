# car_detection

Hello, my name is Kolua and I'm a student.

INFO:  
This repository consists .exe file, 2 .dll files and 1 cascade classifier file( .xml).  
This program allows you to detect cars in an image or video. The program is implemented in the C++ programming language using the OpenCV library. The graphical shell is made using Windows Forms.  

USAGE:  
Download all files.  
Keep all the files in a single folder location.  
Run the application.  

RESULTS:  
The results are truely based on the test images provided by the database: http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/Data/Car/   
I do not guarantee perfect results for images other than those test images.  
For best results, the dimensions of the car should not exceed 150x130px., and it is better to use a test image with a size of 300x250px.. You can use test images of a larger size, but it will decrease during the program to 300x250px., as a result the image will be distorted and it will be difficult to detect the car on it.
